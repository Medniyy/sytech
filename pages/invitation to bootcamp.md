- citadel genesis
- meta
	- better life - motivation
	- in case of bad events - i am protected, in good case - i will live more happily and eat good food
- did you know that you can afford autonomy and freedom by the cost of the car?
- what do you like more? lush green forest or high tech concrete wall?
- well-known fact population density tightly correlates with our happiness
- but how to build your personal autonomy? (what your personal autonomy made of?)
- here is what your personal autonomy comprises
	- you constantly need energy
		- happily sun is shining and wind is blowing almost everywhere
		- the cost of one kw/h renewable solar or wind is something ~1k$ per kw/h
		- you need sustainable needs 3-5 kwt
	- you need water
		- on average 1 sq.m of land produce 0.3-3 m3 of water per year
		- uou need ~ 50 m3 for home needs excluding gardening
		- gather, clean it and drink it
	- you need plants
		- plants are amazing!
		- they can produce everything you need
		- food, medicine, heat, cosmetics, construction, textile and more
- modeling demonstrates that you need 14th species on 500 m3 of land to grow everything you need
- 100% autonomy allows you to aim your attention inside, not outside
- existing system wouldn't let you rest
- but autonomy is hard! you need to learn a lot
	- how soil works
	- how animals, shrooms and plants interact with each other
	- you have to adapt resilient cryptographic communication protocols
	- you have to coordinate the community way better
- understanding that nearly everything must be build from gound up
- lead us to a decision to move to cybervalley and start citadel genesis project
- cybervalley located in one of the most attractive islands in the world - on Bali
- and Bali is located in Indonesia
	- beautiful country with the most lush nature
	- it is the biggest islandic country in the world
	- with a pretty straightforward relocation rule
- cybervalley is a region up in Bali mountains
	- with a perfect fresh climate
	- amazing views
	- enormous nature and biodiversity
	- and most importantly not yet polluted with traffic
	- with still affordable land prices
- citadel genesis is a settlement on the 38 hectars of Cybervalley with three features
	- sustainable infrastructure: sophisticated energy, water and communications system
	- magic forest: forest that gives everything you need for life
	- superintellegence: community empowered by collective intelligence
- it's experiment, how to marry tech and nature
- after 1 year of autonomous life
	- we found out how to build next gen societies
	- with help of affordable low tech solutions
- we invite you to join this venture
- november 1st is the beginning of eduhealth program - BOOTcamp
- during 2 weeks you'll have
	- 20 hours of cutting edge lectures on autonomy
	- 30 hours of real life workouts
	- connection to like-minded people
	- health and mind improvements
- bootcamp will help you to answer these questions:
	- does autonomous life is for you?
	- how to save time and money while moving off grid
	- how to launch your community around the globe
